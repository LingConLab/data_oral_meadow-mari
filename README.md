## About corpus

The corpus contains spoken texts in Meadow Mari (also known as Eastern Mari or formerly Cheremis, M.Mari: Олык марий, Russian: луговой марийский язык; glottocode [mhr]).

The texts for the corpus were recorded in 2000–2004 and in 2018 in the village of Staryj Torjal (Novyj Torjal district, Mari El Republic) and belong to the Sernur-Morkin dialect. This dialect forms the basis of the literary Meadow Mari (Bartseva et al., 2012), thus the corpus texts are close to literary Meadow Mari, but display some non-standard lexical and morphological properties.
